              Diversify was a weekend event at Spotify in Stockholm, where 40 tech students of diverse backgrounds came together and designed, wrote code, and found new friends.
            </p>

            <p>
              They were all teams consisting of an equal share of men and women, and also different technical interests.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>And their results were insanely cool.</strong>
            </p>
          </div>

              <p>
                Technology is all around us, after all. In a larger, high level perspective, Diversify was organized by us due to the current situation in the tech scene: it’s not very gender balanced. We were tired of hosting hackathons with homogen audiences. We wanted change and a different mix of people! Our world is inhabited by both men and women, so why shouldn’t the tech scene reflect that?
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <img src="http://placehold.it/500x300" />
              <p>
                By <strong>forcing</strong> a 50/50 divide between men and women, 40% of the applications to the event (with forty spots) were from women. That has never happened for any of our tech events before. Why? We are not entirely sure. But instead of patting ourselves on the back for this, we should figure out a way to achieve a 50/50 attendance rate <em>without</em> forcing it.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <img src="http://placehold.it/500x300" />

              <p>
                For Diversify, we tried to move away from traditional hackathon concepts (we even avoid using the word ”hackathon” because of its baggage). We refrained from using regular ”hacking food”, like pizza and beer, and had talks and a workshop on diversity. The interface design and idea of each hack was as important as its underlying code.

          <div class="story__ending">
            <p>
              We have now showed for the industry, ourselves and the attendees of Diversify that our hypothesis holds:
            </p>

            <p class="highlight">
              Diverse teams create better products
            </p>

            <p>
              Segregation and exclusion will lead to us missing out on the brightest minds, ideas and products. Let create a tech world where everyone are welcome.

              One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human.

              <strong>Ett Fullkomligt Kaos – Bo Kaspers Orkester</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              After a serious consideration, I&#x27;ve decided to pick a song from the Swedish band &#x27;Bo Kaspers Orkester&#x27; called &#x27;Ett fullkomligt kaos&#x27;. Why? To start with - it is a very good song! For me, the song is about how you can be great and successful without having what others may call &#x27;a perfect life&#x27;. The song is also a kind of mock to the whole lifestyle-community with white homes with gold on the doorknob. I guess that&#x27;s how I would like to see myself, smart and elegant but not always shiny on the outside.

            </p>

            <p>
              These days that would probably be Kygos remix of &#x27;I See Fire&#x27;. It is not really describing me as a person. More like that is what I have been listening to the last two weeks studying to exams. It is an awesome song and I love how it makes me more concentrated and focused on code.

              <strong>Teenage Riot – Sonic Youth</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Teen Age Riot by Sonic Youth. I chose this song not only because it&#x27;s a great song, but also because it&#x27;s the first track on their album &#x27;Daydream Nation&#x27;. I enjoy making a good first impression on people, just like the first track kind of sets the tone for the rest of the album. I think this song introduces you to the album in a flawless way, and I wish I could introduce myself in a similar fashion. (So technically, this song describes what I&#x27;d like to be.)

              This song best describes me: Hall of Fame by The Script. I find this song&#x27;s lyrics so meaningful. I can feel stronger when I listen this song. The best thing in my opinion is to never give up!

              It is really difficult to pick just one. I will go for this as it describes how I generally look at things. I try to be as positive as I can. Life is beautiful and if you don&#x27;t like it for the moment you are not spending it as you should. When you feel like you don&#x27;t belong somewhere try see it as a challenge to work harder to get where you wanna be. Cheer up and enjoy the ride.

              It&#x27;s a song with many different parts. That&#x27;s also how I see about myself. I have many different sides I present at different times. The song has periods of quiet thinking and contemplation. Just like many parts of my life. I really like to think and dream. But then there is the huge orchestral breakdowns. They represent a different part of me. For example when I&#x27;m on stage. Making grand creative gestures and a complete fool of myself. Start with a really &#x27;out there&#x27; idea and execute it to 150%. Take it so far it stops being weird and becomes good. It&#x27;s also a bit off and crazy. Just like me.

            <p>
              I&#x27;m moving pixels left and right, fine-tuning bezier curves to perfection and my calendar keeps yelling at me to be somewhere else. “I’m almost ready!” is what goes through my head on every project. Nothing’s ever going to be perfect and there’s always room for improvement. But hey, that’s the nature of design (and probably life in general) and that’s what I love about it. I also happen to love dinosaurs and electric guitars. Coincidence? I think not.

              <strong>Walk This Way – MØ</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Great artist, great song, great video. Because MØ is one of the most inspiring artist I know and I think she is a great role model for young women like me. I saw her live at Roskilde this summer and it was a CRAZY concert. Such energy. She&#x27;s like WHAT THE FUCK and does what she wants. A feminist icon in my eyes. I also like the lyrics of the song. To me it means that I should follow my dreams even when I&#x27;m in doubt: &#x27;You&#x27;ll find a way, baby, make them all burn.&#x27; And of course, it makes me dance like crazy.

              One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human.

              Aside from the obvious fact that I enjoy sleeping and long weekend mornings like so many others, I feel that dreamer sentiment and playfulness of the song fits me well. The song has a strong connection to games for me as I first heard it during a play through of Little Big Planet 2, one of my favorite video games. It gives me the feeling of wanting to build up things (a big part of the game), which is what I do when I code.

            </p>

            <p>
              The first song that came to my mind is &#x27;Weit Hinaus - Feine Sahne Fischfilet&#x27; and it’s unfortunately in german. But it basically describes a moment where one sits among his/her friends and just enjoys the moment. The song also expresses how much power one gains through friendships and that they give you strength to achieve anything you want. This is a song which describes me pretty well because it is one of my favorite situations. I have a couple of friends that I’m very close with but we don’t see each other often because some of us (including me) live all over the world. But every time we come together for winter holidays or in summer we sit together and our favorite thing is to play the guitar and sing the same songs all over again that we’ve been singing for years now. Those moments are great memories and they give strength to each of us.

              Though question, but at this moment I&#x27;d pick Home by Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros. I think its a great love song and sort of a celebration of life, the way it should be - and the whole song reeks of wanderlust which is how I hope that I am.

              One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human.

              It&#x27;s gives energy just by listening to it, is a bit techno at the same time as funky, and overall sounds freaking awesome.

              This song touches the essentials of me, the combination of my often smiling face and the 73 years of life experience behind it.
