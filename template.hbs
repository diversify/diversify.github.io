              Diversify was a weekend event at Spotify in Stockholm, where 40 tech students of diverse backgrounds came together and designed, wrote code, and found new friends.
            </p>

            <p>
              They were all teams consisting of an equal share of men and women, and also different technical interests.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>And their results were insanely cool.</strong>
            </p>

                Technology is all around us, after all. In a larger, high level perspective, Diversify was organized by us due to the current situation in the tech scene: it‚Äôs not very gender balanced. We were tired of hosting hackathons with homogen audiences. We wanted change and a different mix of people! Our world is inhabited by both men and women, so why shouldn‚Äôt the tech scene reflect that?

              <p>
                By <strong>forcing</strong> a 50/50 divide between men and women, 40% of the applications to the event (with forty spots) were from women. That has never happened for any of our tech events before. Why? We are not entirely sure. But instead of patting ourselves on the back for this, we should figure out a way to achieve a 50/50 attendance rate <em>without</em> forcing it.
              </p>
            </div>

              <p>
                For Diversify, we tried to move away from traditional hackathon concepts (we even avoid using the word ‚Äùhackathon‚Äù because of its baggage). We refrained from using regular ‚Äùhacking food‚Äù, like pizza and beer, and had talks and a workshop on diversity. The interface design and idea of each hack was as important as its underlying code.

              We have now showed for the industry, ourselves and the attendees of Diversify that our hypothesis holds:
            </p>

            <p class="highlight">
              Diverse teams create better products
            </p>

            <p>
              Segregation and exclusion will lead to us missing out on the brightest minds, ideas and products. Let create a tech world where everyone are welcome.
