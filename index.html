              Diversify was a weekend event at Spotify in Stockholm, where 40 tech students of diverse backgrounds came together and designed, wrote code, and found new friends.
            </p>

            <p>
              They were all teams consisting of an equal share of men and women, and also different technical interests.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>And their results were insanely cool.</strong>
            </p>

              <p>
                Technology is all around us, after all. In a larger, high level perspective, Diversify was organized by us due to the current situation in the tech scene: it‚Äôs not very gender balanced. We were tired of hosting hackathons with homogen audiences. We wanted change and a different mix of people! Our world is inhabited by both men and women, so why shouldn‚Äôt the tech scene reflect that?
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <img src="/images/computer.jpg" />
              <p>
                By <strong>forcing</strong> a 50/50 divide between men and women, 40% of the applications to the event (with forty spots) were from women. That has never happened for any of our tech events before. Why? We are not entirely sure. But instead of patting ourselves on the back for this, we should figure out a way to achieve a 50/50 attendance rate <em>without</em> forcing it.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">

              <p>
                For Diversify, we tried to move away from traditional hackathon concepts (we even avoid using the word ‚Äùhackathon‚Äù because of its baggage). We refrained from using regular ‚Äùhacking food‚Äù, like pizza and beer, and had talks and a workshop on diversity. The interface design and idea of each hack was as important as its underlying code.

            <p>
              We have now showed for the industry, ourselves and the attendees of Diversify that our hypothesis holds:
            </p>

            <p class="highlight">
              Diverse teams create better products
            </p>

            <p>
              Segregation and exclusion will lead to us missing out on the brightest minds, ideas and products. Let create a tech world where everyone are welcome.

            <p class="member__song-text">
              After a serious consideration, I&#x27;ve decided to pick a song from the Swedish band &#x27;Bo Kaspers Orkester&#x27; called &#x27;Ett fullkomligt kaos&#x27;. Why? To start with - it is a very good song! For me, the song is about how you can be great and successful without having what others may call &#x27;a perfect life&#x27;. The song is also a kind of mock to the whole lifestyle-community with white homes with gold on the doorknob. I guess that&#x27;s how I would like to see myself, smart and elegant but not always shiny on the outside.

              These days that would probably be Kygos remix of &#x27;I See Fire&#x27;. It is not really describing me as a person. More like that is what I have been listening to the last two weeks studying to exams. It is an awesome song and I love how it makes me more concentrated and focused on code.

              Teen Age Riot by Sonic Youth. I chose this song not only because it&#x27;s a great song, but also because it&#x27;s the first track on their album &#x27;Daydream Nation&#x27;. I enjoy making a good first impression on people, just like the first track kind of sets the tone for the rest of the album. I think this song introduces you to the album in a flawless way, and I wish I could introduce myself in a similar fashion. (So technically, this song describes what I&#x27;d like to be.)

Life is beautiful and if you don&#x27;t like it for the moment you are not spending it as you should. When you feel like you don&#x27;t belong somewhere try see it as a challenge to work harder to get where you wanna be. Cheer up and enjoy the ride.

                Quepic lets users queue songs on Spotify by posting pictures on Instagram. The application then picks a song with reference to the hashtags in the instagram post. Words that are used in the hashtags can define different moods, genres or artists of the music you want. If a request is too divergent from the event settings it will not be granted. The app has an interface where each post resulting in a queued song is visualized. It is meant to be used on a big screen at parties or other events. With Quepic there will be no hour-long play queues of individual taste and no fuss about the playing device. It will enhance the atmosphere.

              It&#x27;s a song with many different parts. That&#x27;s also how I see about myself. I have many different sides I present at different times. The song has periods of quiet thinking and contemplation. Just like many parts of my life. I really like to think and dream. But then there is the huge orchestral breakdowns. They represent a different part of me. For example when I&#x27;m on stage. Making grand creative gestures and a complete fool of myself. Start with a really &#x27;out there&#x27; idea and execute it to 150%. Take it so far it stops being weird and becomes good. It&#x27;s also a bit off and crazy. Just like me.

              This classic girl power anthem originally performed by the ever epic Spice Girls has been interpreted by the too cool for school M√∏. This tribute to friendship that will always be there is all about empowering people around you and growing as a person in the process of doing so. Set to a dreamy unexpectedly catchy soundscape were no dream is too big and the dancing goes on all through the night.

                Equalyze is a simple web application to help you analyze how diverse your playlists are. By checking what gender the artists your playlist consist of, we give you a rough estimation of how diverse your playlist are. We also give you some recommendation of songs to add, based on the artists you already got in the playlist, to get a better diversity on your playlist. Our thought when doing this application were to follow the theme at Diversify and to create an service that could give users a better knowledge of what the actually listen to.

To me it means that I should follow my dreams even when I&#x27;m in doubt: &#x27;You&#x27;ll find a way, baby, make them all burn.&#x27; And of course, it makes me dance like crazy.

              Aside from the obvious fact that I enjoy sleeping and long weekend mornings like so many others, I feel that dreamer sentiment and playfulness of the song fits me well. The song has a strong connection to games for me as I first heard it during a play through of Little Big Planet 2, one of my favorite video games. It gives me the feeling of wanting to build up things (a big part of the game), which is what I do when I code.

              The first song that came to my mind is &#x27;Weit Hinaus - Feine Sahne Fischfilet&#x27; and it‚Äôs unfortunately in german. But it basically describes a moment where one sits among his/her friends and just enjoys the moment. The song expresses how much power one gains through friendships and that they give you strength to achieve anything you want which is why I like it very much.

              Right now, I would have to say &#x27;Shake It Out&#x27; by Florence + The Machine. It&#x27;s all about having made mistakes in the past and trying to move on, possibly from a lost love. I have lived such a dull life the past three years, in a relationship that wasn&#x27;t working, and now I am turning my life around and exploring new things!
