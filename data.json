To start with - it is a very good song! For me, the song is about how you can be great and successful without having what others may call 'a perfect life'. The song is also a kind of mock to the whole lifestyle-community with white homes with gold on the doorknob. I guess that's how I would like to see myself, smart and elegant but not always shiny on the outside."

They represent a different part of me. For example when I'm on stage. Making grand creative gestures and a complete fool of myself. Start with a really 'out there' idea and execute it to 150%. Take it so far it stops being weird and becomes good. It's also a bit off and crazy. Just like me."
